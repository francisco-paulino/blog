##Past
Previously I had an internship at Holcim Mexico, this company focuses on the manufacture of products for construction such as cement and concrete. In my six months there I worked on automation and scripting tools to monitor the production lines for the team in charge of the maintenance of the infrastructure. These tools helped the personnel to monitor in real time the performance of the machines they were in charge of.

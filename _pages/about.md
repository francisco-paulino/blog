#Current#
I'm currently working on infrastructure as a service at IBM, my role focuses on the integration of distributed components for customer applications. These components can be anything from a webserver (Apache, nginx), database management systems (DB2) to middleware that hosts Java based applications (Websphere application Server). The components are hosted on a variety of operating systems (AIX, Redhat, SUSE, Windows) that run on virtualization platforms (VMware) and IBM's Cloud.

#Past#
Previously I had an internship at Holcim Mexico, this company focuses on the manufacture of products for construction such as cement and concrete. In my six months there I worked on automation and scripting tools to monitor the production lines for the team in charge of the maintenance of the infrastructure. These tools helped the personnel to monitor in real time the performance of the machines they were in charge of.

I'm an Engineer currently working on infrastructure as a Service interested on Information Security.

This blog is my first attempt to document my journey on the new skills I'm trying to learn.

For additional context you can read my post ["Why did I start this blog?"](https://francisco-paulino.github.io/firstpost/)

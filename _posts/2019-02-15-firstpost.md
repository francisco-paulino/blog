## Here I share my insights so far from the point where I decided to create a blog to the first post I published

*Please be wary English is not my first language and there might be some errors*

I'm going to start from the beginning, I have been thinking about opening a personal blog for a long time but until now I was not able to get the motivation to do it. I've read somewhere that *"if you trully want to do something you'll find the way and resources to do it no matter how difficult it is"*. That was probably between lines but is the general idea, If I find the reference I'll add it here. Anyway I think that general idea is true, because I used to make excuses and drift around on trivial stuff and almost always ended up procrastinating. I had no intention to work on the things I "wanted" to work on.

Over the past 3 years I have progressively changed this, I have done it by prioritizing, setting goals based on my priorities and tracking the progress of my goals. This has helped me for personal, career and overall goals.

This blog is the result of one of my priorities which is to **learn by doing**. Also it servers multiple purposes:
* Work on my english writing skills
* Have a central repository of information I can look back to (particularly for the technical information I plan to publish)
* The information I share here might be of help for someone else. I'm sure I have found very useful information on other's people blogs.

To manage my blog I decided to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because I can learn to use github repos and I can practice my coding skills; also I used [Jekyll themes](https://jekyllrb.com/) to have my blog ready in about 2 hours.

Finally my next steps on this blog are:
- Configure Google Analytics before going live to track the traffic of the blog
- Add my Professional social network profiles, probably LinkedIn and GitHub

## Here I share my insights so far from the point where I decided to create a blog to the first post I published

I'm going to start from the beginning, there are 3 main reasons I decided to start blogging.

1. Create a part of my online identity as described by Troy Hunt [in his post](https://www.troyhunt.com/why-online-identities-are-smart-career/).
2. Hold my self accountable for the commitments I do towards advancing in my career. I can do this by posting about my progress at least once a week.
3. To have a place where I can document the activities I do in regards of learning new skills, participating in communities and so on.  

I decided to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because It requires the usage of technical skills and tools. In the future I'll probably migrate to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) which I read is a great platform for blogging but for the time being I'll stick to the hardwork of Github Pages which gives me a lot to learn with all the errors I receive when I commit new changes LOL.

I think my next step is to post about my progress on the new skills I'm trying to learn and validate. As a System Administrator with almost 3 years of experience I'm at the point of my career where I want to test my skills against regulated standards such as Professional Certifications.

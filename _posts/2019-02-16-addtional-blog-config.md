## In this post I share the additional config for Google Analytics

The first step is to go to https://analytics.google.com/analytics/.

Sign up using a gmail account, for this purpose I used my personal gmail account.

One interesting fact about the Google Analytics Terms of Service Agreement is the pricing.

As described on section 2 of the Agreement the analytics is provided at no charge for "Hits" below 10,000,000. The definition of a "Hit" is also stated on the Agreement:

*"Hit" means the base unit that the Google Analytics system processes. A Hit may be a call to the Google Analytics system by various libraries, including, Javascript (e.g., analytics.js), Silverlight, Flash, and Mobile. A Hit may currently be a page view, a transaction, item, or event, social interaction, or user timing. Hits may also be delivered to the Google Analytics system without using one of the various libraries by other Google Analytics-supported protocols and mechanisms the Service makes available to You.*

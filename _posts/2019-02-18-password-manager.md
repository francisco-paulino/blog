## Here I'm going to share my experience with one of the Password Managers available on the market and share my experience so far with it

So what is a password manager?
www.techopedia.com describes it as *a software application that is used to store and manage the passwords that a user has for various online accounts and security features. Password managers store the passwords in an encrypted format and provide secure access to all the password information with the help of a master password.*

Now here is some context; I have a lot of accounts on a lot of online services and I couldn't keep up with all of them so I started doing the following:

1. Using passwords that are easy to remember. Probably a word and numbers.
2. Using the same passwords on different accounts. Why should I bother using a different password right?
3. Storing the password on a text file I could easily access, that file was on OneDrive or on Google Drive.

I was doing that until I got pwned, which basically means someone got my email and my password somehow and took over my twitter account. That someone could have probably take over my email and several other accounts because I was using the same email and password but for some reason that someone decided to take only my twitter account, lucky me.

Long story short I saw the potential damage I could have received and I decided to make a list of the accounts I cared about. It didn't take me long to realize I had over 20 accounts between email, social network, financial and government(the ones I use for my visa, passport and taxes) that I cared enough to not lose or get my information stolen.

So I started to google solutions for my current problem and I found 3 things that reduce the change of getting pwned.
1. A password manager
2. Multi-factor authentication
3. Meaningless random character strings

The first one help me to store all my accounts with their proper unique password and locked them under a master password. Here I only need to remember the master password, easy.

Perhaps You've heard of **Multi-factor authentication(MFA)** as that annoying setting corporate asked you to activate, at least that was what I though: *Why should I use my personal phone number? I don't want to be receiving work related stuff to my phone?* But turns out is very important because it adds an extra layer of security.

In contrast with the usual model where only the user/password is required in MFA at least 2 independent factors must be provided to gain access to an account.

* Something you know (user/password)
* Something you have (a token, a smartphone where you receive a unique code
* Something you are (fingerprint, retina scan, voice recognition) this one is for more advanced implementations where security is of critical
